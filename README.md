Excited to share my latest web development project with you all! I've created a weather website that brings you up-to-date weather information using the Tomorrow.io API from RapidAPI. Here are some of the highlights:

🌡️ Accurate Weather Data: Get real-time temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more for any location worldwide.

📈 Interactive Visualizations: Utilized Google Charts to create beautiful area charts that display temperature data for the current day. It's both informative and visually appealing!

🚀 JavaScript Magic: Powered by JavaScript, the website seamlessly fetches data from APIs, performs DOM manipulations, and builds an intuitive user interface.

💾 Future-Proof Storage: I have plans to integrate IndexDB to store data locally on users' devices, ensuring a smoother and more personalized experience.

🌐 Hosted on GitHub Pages: You can check out the project live on GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible to anyone interested.

I'm thrilled about this project and the opportunity to combine my passion for web development with my love for weather data. Stay tuned for more updates and improvements!
